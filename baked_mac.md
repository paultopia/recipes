# Baked Mac 'n Cheese, iteration 1

Experimental.  Concocted from a combination of plausible-looking recipes and adapted to available ingredients and equipment.  May suck. 

# Environment

Outdoor humidity 56%.  Indoor humidity and temperature unknown. Altitude: Chicago, 25 stories up. Electric oven, Frigidaire (need to turn up model number).

# Equipment

- Pyrex pan, dimensions 13x9x2.25 inches, and about 0.5cm thick glass
- Mixing bowl. Measurements unknown but pretty big and probably not super relevant. 


# Ingredients

- Pasta.  1 box of Barilla whole grain elbows, which is 454 grams  PLUS one box of annie's shells and aged cheddar mac and cheese, which is 170 grams = 624g pasta.
- the cheese powder from the anie's box
- 2 eggs
- 3 tablespoons flour 
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter
- 1.5 cups skim milk
- CHEESES
  - 2 cups grated/shredded (are these different?) "mild cheddar" of which 1/2 cup will be reserve for top
  - 1 cup aged cheddar, all for reserve
  - 1 cup gouda, of which 1/2 cup reserve
  - 2 cup mozzerella (no reserve)
  - 1 cup monterey jack, 1/2 for reserve except it turns out that monterey jack just turns into fucking mush when you try to grate it, so I had to switch to slices and it isnt measured and the cheese list stops here because I've already spent hours on this shit and I don't want to have to clean out all the monterey-jack filled holes in the fucking cheese grater in order to be able to grate any more and next time I'm just putting that shit in the food processor.


# Steps 

1.  Preheat oven to 350f. 
2.  Pre-grate cheese and lay out all other ingredients, measured, close to hand so that the pasta isn't boiling over and flooding the house when you're trying to grate cheese
3.  Mix together milk, flour, egg, annies cheese powder, butter, and cheeses OTHER THAN RESERVE CHEESE NOTED ABOVE, and stir, in mixing bowl.

## boil the pasta

4.  Fill 5 quart pan with water as close as possible (going to have to fucking guess at displacement of pasta because I don't have one actually big enough for what it says on the box for the amount of pasta going in, so, YOLO.), plus 1 turn of the salt grinder (needs real measurement) and a capful of olive oil (needs real measurement)
5.  Boil pasta 5.5 minutes.
6.  Drain pasta, set aside.

## oven setup

7.  Butter the sides of the pyrex dish
8.  Add the pasta to the dish
9. Add spices to the dish.  This is going to depend on what's available, and I don't have good measurements for these right now, but I'm thinking pepper, a small amount of salt, paprika, cayenne, and celery salt at a minimum; possibly also cumin and corriander if I can find any in a convenient form.  maybe curry powder or barbecue powder if there's any lying around. 
10. Add the sauce to the dish and stir
11. Add the aged cheddar to the top. 
12. Bake for 35 minutes
13. Let stand for 10 mins.
